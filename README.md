# kickstarter-analysis

## Overview of Project
An analysis of Kickstarter campaign information specifically looking at the subcategory of 'plays'.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to assist Louise in best determining her course of action to successfully fund her Kickstarter campaign. She wishes to fund her play "Fever" and estimates her budget to be about $10,000. We will look at the Kickstarter data for the parent category of Theater and subcategory for "plays" to determine what is the best goal amount to set for her campaign and what date she should launch her campaign to be most successful in fully funding her project.

## Analysis and Challenges
Overall the Theater category of Kickstarters is fairly successful and no Kickstarters in the 'play' subcategory have been canceled. No challenges or difficulties were encountered.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Based on the data provided the best month to launch a Theater Kickstarter campaign is the month of May. May is the month that has the most successful launches. December is the month that shows the least amount of successful campaign launches. In fact, December has almost equal amounts of failed and successful campaigns launched. A range of launch dates for the highest probability for success would be April through June.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Plays with the goals of less than $5,000 were approximately 78% successful. The success rate gradually declined. When the goals hit about $15,000 the failed rate of Kickstarters outweighed the successful Kickstarters. Goals for Kickstarters between $35,000 and $45,000 had a 62% success rate. Plays with Kickstarter goals of more than $45,000 are completely unsuccessful at meeting their goals.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I did not encounter any difficulties or challenges with the dataset.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    1. Kickstarters that are launched in April or May have the highest chances of meeting their goal.
    2. Kickstarts launched in November and December are least likely to meeting their goal.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    If Louise has a Kickstarter goal for the full $10,000 she estimates to be her budget, there is a 54% chance of her Kickstarter being fully funded and approximately 46% of it failing. Based on the data, her chances of fully funding her Kickstarter are greater if she keeps her goal closer to half her budget at about $5,000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    A limitation of the dataset that I see, is that the Outcomes vs Launch chart only takes into account the month the Kickstarters are launched, if it was combined to somehow reflect the goal of the Kickstarter as all it would have even more fine tuned information for Louise to make her best deciision.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    Another table we could create would be average donation for successful and failed Kickstarters of the 'plays' subcategory. We could possibly make a table or chart that combines the Launch dates and the Goals to see how the outcome is reflected.
